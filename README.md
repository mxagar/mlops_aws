# MLOps with AWS

This repository collects material on Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Data Operations using AWS. I use several sources, and for each of them I have a dedicated folder.

## `ml_aws` - Machine Learning School by Santiago Valderrama

This guide started as a collection of notes after following the cohort-based course [Machine Learning School](https://svpino.gumroad.com/l/mlp) by [Santiago Valderrama](https://twitter.com/svpino) .

The forked Github repository with the code is this one:

## `aws_guide` - The Good Parts of AWS by Daniel Vasallo

These are my personal notes of the book [The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts) by Daniel Vassallo and Josh Pschorr.
