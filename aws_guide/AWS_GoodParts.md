# The Good Parts of AWS: Personal Notes

These are my personal notes of the book "The Good Parts of AWS" by Daniel Vassallo and Josh Pschorr.

I have a local PDF of the book: [`The_Good_Parts_of_AWS_Vasallo.pdf`](./The_Good_Parts_of_AWS_Vasallo.pdf), not committed to the repository; additionally, I have a copy in my Dropbox:

    ~/Dropbox/Documentation/books/AWS/The_Good_Parts_of_AWS_Vasallo.pdf

However, none of those is public; instead, if you'd like to read the book, you could purchase it in Gumroad: [The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts).
